## Preface

#### We control complexity by
* building abstractions that hide details when appropriate
* establishing conventional interfaces that enables us to construct systems by combining standard, well-understood pieces in a 'mix and match' way.
* We control complexity by designing new language for describing a design, each of which emphasizes particular aspects of the design and deemphasizes others.

#### The elements of Programming
* The programming language serves as a framework within which we organize our ideas about processes.
* Thus when we describe a language we should pay particular attention to the means that the language provides for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas.
* Every powerful programming language has three mechanisms to accomplishing this:
  1. Primitive expression 
  2. Means of combination
  3. Means of abstraction
